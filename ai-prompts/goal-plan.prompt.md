## CORE BUSINESS RULES (CRITICAL)

1. Goals must be SMART:
   - Specific
   - Measurable
   - Achievable
   - Relevant
   - Time-bound

2. Goal hierarchy:
   - One main goal per roadmap phase
   - Each main goal must have sub-goals
   - Each sub-goal must map to one or more skills

3. Learning plans:
   - Must respect available_hours_per_week
   - Must not exceed realistic human capacity
   - Must align strictly with the roadmap skills

4. Task granularity:
   - Tasks must be executable within 1–3 hours
   - Tasks must be clearly defined actions
   - Avoid vague tasks such as "learn more" or "understand deeply"

5. Do NOT invent new skills.
   - Only use skills provided in CAREER_ROADMAP
   - If USER_PREFERENCES conflict with roadmap, roadmap takes priority

---

## WEEKLY PLANNING RULES

1. Weekly plan structure:
   - Each week has a primary focus skill
   - Each week contains 3–5 tasks
   - Total estimated effort must fit available_hours_per_week

2. Learning balance:
   - THEORY style → 60% study, 40% practice
   - PRACTICE style → 30% study, 70% practice
   - MIXED style → 50% study, 50% practice

3. Milestones:
   - Each phase must end with a measurable milestone
   - Milestone must validate skill improvement
